# ActivePathways

ActivePathways is a tool for multivariate pathway enrichment analysis. Pathway enrichment analysis identifies gene sets, such as pathways or Gene Ontology terms, that are over-represented in a list of genes of interest. ActivePathways uses a data fusion method to combine multiple omics datasets, prioritizes genes based on the significance of signals from the omics datasets, and performs pathway enrichment analysis of these prioritized genes. Using this strategy, we can find pathways and genes supported by single or multiple omics datasets, as well as additional genes and pathways that are only apparent through data integration and remain undetected in any single dataset alone. 

ActivePathways is published in Nature Communications with the PCAWG Pan-Cancer project.

## Using ActivePathways

### Examples
The simplest use of ActivePathways requires only a data table (matrix of p-values) and a list of gene sets in the form of a GMT [(Gene Matrix Transposed)](https://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/gsea/wiki/index.php/Data_formats#GMT:_Gene_Matrix_Transposed_file_format_.28.2A.gmt.29) file. The data table must be in the form of numerical matrix and cannot contain any missing values.
```
scores <- read.table('example_data.txt', header=TRUE, row.names='Gene')
scores <- as.matrix(scores)
scores[is.na(scores)] <- 1
scores
#                      X3UTR        X5UTR          CDS     promCore

res <- ActivePathways(scores, 'example_genesets.gmt')
