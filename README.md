# activePathways

activePathways is a tool for multivariate pathway enrichment analysis. Pathway enrichment analysis identifies gene sets, such as pathways or Gene Ontology terms, that are over-represented in a list of genes of interest. activePathways implements an algorithm to perform pathway enrichment analysis on a data set that contains multiple variables for each gene. For example, the data may contain the confidence that the gene is a driver as reported by several tools, or it may contain differential expression values across different genetic regions such as coding regions and promoter regions.

## Installation

#### devtools:
Using the R package `devtools`, run
`devtools::install_github('https://github.com/reimandlab/activePathways')`

#### From source
Clone the repository: `https://github.com/reimandlab/activePathways.git`
Open R in the directory you cloned the package in and run `install.packages('activePathways', repos=NULL)`

## Using activePathways

### Examples
The simplest use of activeDriver requires only a data table and a list of gene sets in the form of a GMT [(Gene Matrix Transposed)](https://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/gsea/wiki/index.php/Data_formats#GMT:_Gene_Matrix_Transposed_file_format_.28.2A.gmt.29) file. The data must be in the form of numerical matrix and cannot contain any missing values
```
scores <- read.table('example_data.txt', header=TRUE, row.names='Gene')
scores <- as.matrix(scores)
scores[is.na(scores)] <- 1
